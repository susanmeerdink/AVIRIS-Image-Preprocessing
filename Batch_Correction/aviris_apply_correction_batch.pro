PRO aviris_apply_correction_batch
;This code applies a correction to aviris imagery from the santa barbara flightbox
;Atmospheric correction on teh AVIRIS images varies quite a bit from date to date
;Using the Storke Post Office ASD spectra and spectra from FL06, I have derived a multiplying factor for each date
;cor130411,cor130606,cor131125,cor140416,cor150606,&cor140829 are hardcoded factors derived from the above process
;See file Determining AVIRIS Correction Factors for details
;This code will also updated the band names, wavelengths, and bad band list so that all file will have the same
;Output image will have all Bad Bands with a value of 0
